# Recipes

Recipes app using dotnet core and Vue with Typescript. The full project will be deployed as a Private service. Please contact me if interested in joining. Hosting in the cloud isn't free. I will eventually also attempt to host this as a demo project somehow.

## ToDo:
- update front end API queries to satisfy the new API
- pick a theme and update styling in the front end
- write unit tests!!!
